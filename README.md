# Sorting Visualiser

## Tech Stack
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap

## Idea
I plan to make this sorting visualizer web application to help the beginners in programming to gain more knowledge and understanding on sorting algorigthms by visualizing them.
This application will support the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

## Implementation
HTML, CSS, Bootsrap will be used to create the web application structure and styling.
It will be a responsive webiste.
Using JavaScript, I will write the codes for the sorting algorithms. And using JavaScript only, will implement the Visualiser, by manipulating the required HTML amd CSS.

## Timeline
By the end of July, I will try to implement the sorting algorithms in JavaScript.
Also, will create a basic structure of the webpage I want.
In August, I will try to work on the visualisation implementation and final touches to website.

## Application of project
This project will be useful for anyone who wants to visualise how a sorting algorithm works, step-by-step.
Visualization will lead to clear understanding of concepts.

## Outcome of project
By making this project, I will be able to test my Frontend and basic DSA skills implementation in real-world project.
