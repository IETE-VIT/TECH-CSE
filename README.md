# Code Sharing Platform.

## Tech Stack used
MERN

## Idea
I plan to build a platform for developers where they can collaborate ,discuss codes and work together. The platform will also have a white board and video call feature which will
make the process of algorithm discussion and problem solving more efficient. 

## Method of Implementation
- I will make ue of React for the frontend of website.
- For making the code editor I'll make use of monaco npm module. 
- The whiteboard will be implemented using javascript library such as zwibbler and for video calling I'll be using 3rd party applicaition such as jitsi.

## Timeline
The frontend of the project and code editor implementation will be comepleted by the end of July. Video call feature and whiteboard will be implemented untill mid August.

## Application of project
The project is made for developers to make it easier for them to collaborate and discuss.

## Expected Outcome
This project will be a great learning experience as I'll be building a MERN stack webapp and will also learn to integrate 3rd party applications in my webapp.
